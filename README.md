# Human Values

Repository of the paper ["Investigating Human Values in Online Communities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14177)

Still a work in progress.

1. Subreddit Schwartz values can be found in `outputs/subreddit_schwartz_values.csv`.
2. Figures from the paper can be found in `outputs/`

## Training

We use the training code from `https://github.com/m0re4u/value-disagreement`, the repositopry of the paper "Do Differences in Values Influence Disagreements in Online Discussions?".
Either use their repository to train the model, or follow their instructions while using ours, which contains a simplified, slim, version of their code. The training script is `scripts/training_moral_values/train_paper.py`.

## Data analysis

TBD
